# SEO CDN Prevention - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Canonical Tags
Added `<link rel="canonical">` to all HTML pages pointing to `https://kejayacapo.shop`:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ duka.html
- ✅ about.html
- ✅ cart.html
- ✅ checkout.html
- ✅ terms.html

### 2. Robots.txt
Created `/robots.txt` file with:
- Default allow rules for primary domain
- Sitemap reference

### 3. HTTP Headers
Updated `netlify.toml` with:
- `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` for CDN domain
- CORS headers maintained

## 🎯 How It Works

### Canonical Tags
```html
<link rel="canonical" href="https://kejayacapo.shop/page.html">
```
- Tells search engines the "official" URL
- Prevents duplicate content issues
- Works immediately

### X-Robots-Tag Header
```
X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow
```
- Blocks search engines from indexing `*.netlify.app`
- Applied via Netlify configuration
- Active immediately after deployment

## 📋 Next Steps (Manual Configuration Required)

### 1. Set Up Custom Domain in Netlify
```
1. Netlify Dashboard → Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add custom domain: kejayacapo.shop
3. Configure DNS (A record or CNAME)
4. Enable HTTPS
5. Set as primary domain
```

### 2. Verify Implementation
```bash
# Check canonical tags
curl https://kejayacapo.netlify.app/ | grep canonical

# Check X-Robots-Tag header
curl -I https://kejayacapo.netlify.app/ | grep X-Robots-Tag

# Check robots.txt
curl https://kejayacapo.netlify.app/robots.txt
```

### 3. Monitor in Google Search Console
```
1. Add both domains (kejayacapo.shop and *.netlify.app)
2. Set kejayacapo.shop as preferred
3. Submit sitemap
4. Monitor indexing status
```

## 🔍 Testing

### Verify CDN is NOT indexed:
```
Google search: site:kejayacapo.netlify.app
Expected: No results (after re-crawl)
```

### Verify Primary domain IS indexed:
```
Google search: site:kejayacapo.shop
Expected: Your pages appear
```

## 📊 Expected Timeline

- **Immediate**: Canonical tags active
- **24-48 hours**: Headers propagate
- **1-2 weeks**: Google re-crawls and respects changes
- **2-4 weeks**: CDN URLs removed from search results
