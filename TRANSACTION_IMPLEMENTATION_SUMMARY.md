   ↓
5. M-Pesa callback received → Transaction updated (status: completed)
   ↓
6. Polling detects completion
   ↓
7. Order created automatically

## 🎨 User Experience

### **Before (Incomplete)**
```
User pays → STK push sent → "Waiting..." → ❌ Nothing happens
```

### **After (Complete)** ✅
```
User pays → STK push sent → Real-time status updates → 
Payment confirmed → Order created → Cart cleared → 
Confirmation page → Email received
```

## 📊 Transaction States

| State | Description | Next State |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| `initiated` | STK push sent, waiting for PIN | `pending` |
| `pending` | PIN entered, waiting for callback | `completed` or `failed` |
| `completed` | Payment successful | Order created |
| `failed` | Payment failed/cancelled | Can retry |

---

## ⏱️ Timing

- **Polling Interval:** 3 seconds
- **Max Attempts:** 40 (2 minutes total)
- **Typical Callback Time:** 10-30 seconds
- **Order Creation:** < 1 second

---

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. ✅ **Authentication Required** - JWT token validated
2. ✅ **Transaction Linking** - CheckoutRequestID prevents tampering
3. ✅ **Amount Verification** - From M-Pesa callback, not frontend
4. ✅ **Idempotency** - Duplicate callbacks handled gracefully
5. ✅ **User Verification** - Transaction linked to authenticated user

---

## 📧 Email Flow

### **Customer Email**
- Sent by M-Pesa callback
- Contains order number, receipt, items, total
- Professional HTML template

### **Admin Email**
- Sent by M-Pesa callback
- Contains customer info, payment details
- Action required notice

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test Scenarios**
- ✅ Successful payment
- ✅ Failed payment
- ✅ Cancelled payment
- ✅ Timeout scenario
- ✅ Network errors
- ✅ Duplicate callbacks

### **Verification**
```bash
# Check transaction status
curl "https://kejayacapo.shop/.netlify/functions/transaction-status?checkoutRequestId=XXX"

# View transactions in Supabase
SELECT * FROM transactions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

# View orders
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

### **2. Deploy**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Implement complete transaction verification flow"
git push
```

### **3. Verify**

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### **Key Metrics**
1. Transaction success rate
2. Average callback time
3. Timeout rate
4. Order creation success rate
5. Email delivery rate

### **Database Queries**
```sql
-- Today's success rate
SELECT 
  status, 
  COUNT(*) as count,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () as percentage
FROM transactions
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY status;

-- Recent failures
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE status = 'failed'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
